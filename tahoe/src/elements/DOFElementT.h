 * additional degrees of freedom that are generated at the element
 * level. To initialize generation of element degrees of freedom,
 * the element must register with the XDOF_ManagerT using
 * XDOF_ManagerT::Register. After registration, the XDOF_ManagerT
 * uses this interface to allocate/re-allocate element degrees
 * of freedom for each load increment. The number of tag sets
 * requested by the group is set during with XDOF_ManagerT::Register.
 * Initialization of the element tags is by the following sequence:\n
 * (1) DOFElementT::SetDOFTags - determine number of tags needed in each set\n
 * (2) DOFElementT::GenerateElementData - reset connectivities with new tag sets\n
 * (3) DOFElementT::ResetDOF - initialize degrees of values\n*/
