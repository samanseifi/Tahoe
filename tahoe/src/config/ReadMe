The .h and .make files in this directory are generated automatically when
executing "make init" in the top-level directory. The .h files are C/C++ 
headers that control which directories are included or excluded in the build 
process. The .h files are generated during "make init" ONLY if they are missing. 
Otherwise, these files maintain their settings. Sections of the code are 
excluded by commenting out the associate #define statement. The .make files are
regenerated EVERY time "make init" is called. These files should not be edited 
directly. They will be regenerated to reflect the settings in the associated
.h file. The .make files contain "make" macro definitions.

The .h and .make files can also be regenerated by executing "make update_config"
in the top-level directory; however, the configuration of headers files, object
file lists, and file dependencies will not be up to date until "make init" is
executed. The .h and .make files are deleted when "make clean" is executed in
the top-level directory.

Automatic generation of the .h and .make files requires Perl. If Perl is not
available, the .tmpl files should be copied to corresponding .h and .make files.
In this case, both the .h files and .make files will need to be edited manually
in order to change the build configuration. Any changes to these files requires
"make init" be executed again in the top-level directory in order to bring the
auxiliary build files and settings up to date.
