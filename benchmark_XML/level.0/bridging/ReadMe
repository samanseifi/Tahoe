This directory contains tests of the coupled-atomistic continuum capability in 
Tahoe. The tests in each of the directories is described below:
(1) simple tests of projecting the atomistic solution onto a FE mesh
	projection/bridge.2D.0.in - 2D projection using a global L2 projection
	projection/bridge.2D.1.in - 2D projection using a MLS with a Gaussian window function
	projection/bridge.2D.2.in - 2D projection using a MLS with a cubic spline window function
	projection/bridge.3D.0.in - 3D projection using a global L2 projection
	projection/bridge.3D.1.in - 3D projection using a MLS with a Gaussian window function
	projection/bridge.3D.2.in - 3D projection using a MLS with a cubic spline window function
	
(2) simple tests of interpolation of an FE solution onto an atomistic crystal. Even
	though the interpolation does not involve the meshfree shape function, this cases
	are included to verify that interpolation works correctly with those bridging
	scale solvers.
	interpolate/bridge.in - 2D interpolation in quadrilateral elements
	interpolate.meshfree.1/bridge.in - 2D interpolation in quadrilateral elements
	interpolate.meshfree.2/bridge.in - 2D interpolation in quadrilateral elements

(3) quasistatic coupled calculations using MLS to project the FE solution onto the
	ghost atoms in of the atomistic crystal. All examples use the "multi-Tahoe" solver,
	which solves the atomistic and continuum systems simultaneously (unlike (4))
	meshfree/bridge.mf.in - 2D calculation, no cross terms, no bond density correction
	meshfree.1/bridge.mf.in - 2D calculation, with cross terms, with bond density correction,
		with constraints enforced on densities using augmented Lagrange multipliers	
	meshfree.2/bridge.mf.in - 2D calculation, with cross terms, with bond density correction,
		with constraints enforced on densities using a penalty method

(4) edge - coupled calculation using a staggered solution scheme (switching between
	solving the atomistic and continuum problem until the total problem converges), 
	without cross terms or overlap correction in the for the bond density. This converges
	so slowly it is not included in the run.batch.

(5) BSM - examples/benchmarks of the Wagner-Karpov-Liu Bridging Scale Method, with MD comparison files.
