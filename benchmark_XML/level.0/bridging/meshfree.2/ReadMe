The bridging scale example in this directory is run twice in order to
verify that the overlap cell is properly written and read from the
.overlap file. During the first run, the overlap region is calculated
and written to the .overlap file. During the second run, the overlap
information is read from the .overlap instead of being calculated.
The reference results were calculated without the .overlap file.
