### Notes in the split/join tests ###

These are two test must be run together. The first test produces a decomposed
geometry. The second test joins existing results files using the decomposed
geometry file. These joined results are tested against the benchmarks. The
geometry files reside in the decomp directory. The split results files are
in the split directory. During "make clean", the decomposed geometry files are
removed and copies of the split results files are moved to the inputoutput
directory. "make clean" must be executed before the join test will run.
