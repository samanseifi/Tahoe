These are instructions for working with the code in the development module. 
The process is a little more complicated than working with the other optional 
modules because the dependencies between Tahoe and the development module are 
bi-directional.

(1) Configure and build the toolbox in the usual manner.

(2) Configure, but do not build the development module. Configuration is the 
    same as the other modules:
    - copy makefile.template to makefile
    - set the HOME_DIR macro
    - set the ARCH macro

(3) Configure the tahoe module. The first three steps are the standard ones, 
    but a couple additional steps are now required with the development module:
    - copy makefile.template to makefile
    - set the HOME_DIR macro
    - set the ARCH macro
    - in the "build options" section of the makefile, uncomment the macros for 
      the development module. These macros all start with DEV_ . This step is 
      the same as you would normally do with any of the other optional modules.
    - find the UP_TO_DATE macro, and comment/uncomment the definitions as

#UP_TO_DATE = NONE
UP_TO_DATE = $(DEV_DIR)

Any make commands you issue in the tahoe directory will first be run on any 
modules listed in the UP_TO_DATE list before being executed on the tahoe module. 
This list must be defined as NONE if the list is empty.

That's essentially it. In the tahoe module, you can now type "make init build" 
which will initialize and build BOTH the development and tahoe modules. Notice 
that you never need to go to the development directory to run make commands. 
If you want to exclude parts of the development and tahoe modules from the 
build using the new configuration options:

(1) "make init" in the tahoe directory

(2) edit the .h files in:

    tahoe/src/config
    development/src/config

    to include/exclude which ever sections you want.

(3) "make init build" in the tahoe directory
