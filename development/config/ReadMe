The .conf files in this directory are part of a build configuration system
that controls which directories are included or excluded in the build 
process. The configuration of the build is NOT customized by editing these
files. The build settings are controlled by the .h files in the

	development/src/config
	
directory. See the ReadMe file there for more information.
