How to use ellip3d

1. compile

   1) edit main.cpp for your specific simulation type and parameters.
   2) edit parameter.cpp to change more parameters if necessary.
   3) edit makefile to toggle on/off OPENMP (default on).
   4) make
   5) copy ellip3d, main.cpp, parameter.cpp to your simulation directory.

2. run

   serial mode: ./ellip3d > timelog &

   openmp mode: ./ellip3d n > timelog & where n is the number of threads 
   for share-memory mode parallel computing. It is recommended that 
   n=4, 6 or 12 depending on your platform. This command line argument 
   bypasses the need of environment variable OMP_NUM_THREADS, which is 
   usually set by export OMP_NUM_THREADS=n.
