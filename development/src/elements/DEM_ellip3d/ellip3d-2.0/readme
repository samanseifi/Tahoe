How to use ellip3d

1. compile

   1) edit main.cpp for your specific simulation type and parameters.
   2) edit parameter.cpp to change more parameters if necessary.
   3) edit makefile to toggle on/off OPENMP (on by default).
   4) make
   5) copy ellip3d, main.cpp, parameter.cpp to your simulation directory.

2. run

   serial mode: ./ellip3d &

   openmp mode: ./ellip3d n& 
   where n is the number of threads. It is recommended that n=4, 6 or 12 
   depending on your platform. This command line argument bypasses the 
   need of environment variable OMP_NUM_THREADS, which is usually set by 
   command export OMP_NUM_THREADS=n.

3. job script example for Torque/PBS

   !/bin/sh
   #PBS -N example
   #PBS -l nodes=1:ppn=12
   #PBS -l walltime=01:00:00
   cd $PBS_O_WORKDIR
   ellip3d 12
