Note: Because paraEllip3d uses different data formats, we distinguish it by adding a suffix 
"3" to the code name, for example, plot3, which means the plot version for paraEllip3d. 
Codes without such suffix work for ellip3d and ellip3d-2.0 data format.

plot:  
it plots all particles at a time as a snapshot. Animations can be made by combining snapshots.

plotsec:
it plots half of all particles from a cross-sectional perspective. Animations can be made by
combining snapshots.

plotmz:  
it plots each particle as a zone.

plot1pc: (plot-1-particle-contacting) 
it plots one particle and its contacting neighbours as a snapshot. Animations can be made by
combining snapshots, however, it plots a neighour only when the neighbour is in contact with
it, so a neighbour may first appear and  then disappear in animation.

plot1pp: (plot-1-particle-possible)
it plots a particle and its possible neighbours as a snapshot. Animations can be made by
combining snapshots.

plot1pmz: (plot-1-particle-multiple_zones)
it plots one particle and its contacting neighbours as a snapshot, each particle being a zone.

plotvec: 
it plots vectors such as force and velocity.

probe1p:
it extracts a particle's information.

probedual:
it extracts contact info between two particles.

plotpile, plotsecpile:
it plots for the case of rectangular pile specifically.

initfree:
it extracts free particles' information for the case of fixed-particle-boundary.

mergeContact:
merge particle contact info from multiple processes and remove redundance.
paraEllip3d no longer outputs multiple data files for contact info, instead, it prints one 
contact info file using parallel IO.

uniqueContact:
remove redundance (unique) in particle contact info.

dupSpecimen:
duplicate specimen in x, y, z directions.
