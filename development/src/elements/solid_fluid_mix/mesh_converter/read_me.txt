Mesh created by Cubit mesh generator has its own connectivity assumption which is not the same as Tahoe connectivity assumption (Patran vs Hughes book; Tahoe uses Hughes book convention). A C++ code has been written (genesis_txt_to_geom.cxx) to create .geom input file for Tahoe with consistent connectivity assumption. The executable version of this file which is named <converter> is used to do this conversion. converter, receives input.txt file (text file) and generates output.geom file.

In order to use this program, after creating mesh with cubit do the following steps:
1- export that mesh as a genesis (input.g) file.
2- create text file associated with genesis file using the following command:
>exotxt input.g input.txt
3- run converter program:
>converter
Note: converter and input.txt should be in the same directory.
4- If you want, you can rename output.geom. Then copy this geometry file to the geometry directory.

Note1: reading and writing sidesets are not implemented to the converter program. This part is ignored in conversion.

Note2: you can look at the genesis geometry file (input.g) in paraview to assign correct boundaryconditions to node sets.(in output.geom, connectivity has been changed. Node numbers and node sets are similar to the genesis file)
