# Scripts and helper apps for running Dakota/Tahoe optimization
#
INSTALLATION:
(1) copy makefile.tmpl to makefile
(2) edit makefile - set HOME_DIR, ARCH and other configuration options
(3) execute "make" to see available options

Note: installation of the toolbox is required.

CONTENTS:
(1) dakota2tahoe.pl
Perl script to read a DAKOTA variable definition file and insert the variables
into the parameter values of a (Tahoe) XML file. A template XML files must be
provided where the parameters to be substituted are defined as in:

	Poisson_ratio="nu"
	
where nu the name given the variable in the Dakota input file.

(2) least_square.cpp least_square_trap.cpp
Helper apps to compute the normalized rms error of two piece-wise linear functions
defined as xy pairs saved to a text file.

least_square - integrates squared-error between two piecewise linear functions exactly
least_square_trap - integrates squared-error between two piecewise linear functions
	using a trapezoidal integration scheme.

(3) extract_1D.cpp extract_CT.cpp
Helper apps to extract xy-data from Tahoe results.

(4) data/
Example xy data files used with "make test".

(5) example/

search.in - Dakota input file
fvsd - reference results
mat.2.a.xml.tmpl - Tahoe input file template
error_func.csh - script for Dakota/Tahoe communication

Dakota parameter fitting example. If dakota and tahoe can be found in the standard paths,
this example can be executed with "make dakota". Otherwise, the example can be run directly
from the example/ directory, where error_func.csh needs to be edit to that TAHOE is set to
the path to the tahoe executable.
