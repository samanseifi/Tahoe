This is the documentation for some simple matlab scripts to analyze
tahoe output files.

I think it is simplest to go through the functionality using a simple
example.
In the benchmark module consider the case presented in
level.0/2Delastostatic/gravity.0.in

Run that case.

start matlab

add the path to the matlab scripts:

>> addpath('path where you put the scripts');

read in the geometry information:

>> [xy,elementsets,nodesets] = readGeom('quad4.2x2.geom'); 

xy now contains the nodal positions
elementsets contains the element sets
nodesets contains the nodesets

you can now plot the geometry using:

>> plotMesh (xy, elementsets, 0, 'w','k',1,1);

A quick "help plotMesh" shows you what all the options are.
The above command will display the mesh with dotted black outlines and
white interiors. It will also display all node numbers.

Now read in the results of the simulation:

>> [t,nodaldata,valDescr] = readNodal('gravity.0.run');   

t now contains the time steps (only one in this case)
nodaldata is the nodal data as a large matrix
valDescr is a string field with descriptions of what each values are

It is easiest to convert this into a structure array in matlab using:

>> nDat = createValStruct(nodaldata,valDescr); 

nDat is a struct array that contains the fields (for this simulation):
D_X, D_Y, s11, s22, s12

Hence if you whould like to know s11 at node 4 at timestep 1 just
type:

>> nDat(1,4).s11

You can plot your values using:

>> plotGroup (xy, elementsets,1, nDat, 1,'s22', 'k')
 
This will plot the s22 stress of elementset 1 timestep 1 with black
outlines for the elements.


General Notes:

- You can get more information about all these commands by typing:
>> help commandname

- The reading in of tahoe files is a little sketchy. It seems to work
  for the things I have tested but that does not mean that you can
  come up with a valid input file for tahoe that would break these
  scripts.

- These scripts are designed to handle 2D simulations so far.
