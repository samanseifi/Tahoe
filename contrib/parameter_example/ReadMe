This directory contains an example of how to use the parameter tree classes to define
the parameters needed by a class, how to read and validate input from a file, and how
to construct an object based on a validated parameter list. The example is house with
both required and optional elements.

The test program needs to be run from the example directory. It does the following:
(1) collects a complete description of parameters for a house
(2) writes the description to a file in the form of an XML DTD to the file "house.dtd"
(3) reads the example input file "house2.xml"
(4) validates the input against description provided by the house for those parameters
    present in the input and write these to "house_valid.xml" and as more readable
    output to "house.out"
(5) sends the validated list to a house for construction

Reference results of the test program are in example/benchmark.
