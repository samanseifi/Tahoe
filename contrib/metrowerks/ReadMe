The files

tahoe.pch++
tahoeMSLHeaders++.cp

can be used to generate precompiled header files for compiling Tahoe using
Metrowerks CodeWarrior. Precompiled headers do at least 2 good things:

(1) precompiling most of the C/C++ standard headers results in much faster
    compilation of your code.

(2) they provide a mechanism for setting compiler options that would normally
    be handled with flags when using standard command line compilation tools.
    
To generate a precompiled header, include the file tahoe.pch++ in a project.
A precompiled header file will be generated when you compile this file. You
then need to put the name of the precompiled header file in the "Prefix File"
in the

	[project name] Setting -> Language Settings -> C/C++ Language
	
preference pane.

These files have been tested with CodeWarrior 5-7.
