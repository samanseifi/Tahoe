This little program read in atomic coordinates and displacements in
Paradyn output format, fits a moving least squares displacement field
to the results and calculates first and second gradients of the field.
The field gradients are used to construct a deformation gradient, which
is fed to a Cauchy-Born constitutive model to return the stress and
acoustic wave speeds for the continuum model at the given state of
deformation. The results are written to an output file.

See the example directory for a test case.

NOTE: due to the structure of the materials code in Tahoe, you will need
      to link in all optional libraries that were enabled during compilation
      of toolbox and tahoe.
