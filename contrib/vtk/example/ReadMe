This directory contains input scripts for the vtk_console that 
demonstrate some of the basic functionality. They can be run 
from the console using the 'read' command, i.e.,

    > read demo

The script 'demo' runs each of the scripts in this directory.
They can also be run individually. In order to run correctly,
the script 'basics' must be executed as

    > read basics false

which indicates that the script should not terminate on errors.
The script contains some intentional errors to demonstrate how
the console handles them.
